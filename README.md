## 💡 Philosophy

Software development is getting complex, with tons of APIs/Libraries coming in. Things break due to various reasons but there no way to have conifdence when you develop.

This slows devs, and also gets angry customers, stakeholder. This all is chaos, knowing when things break is critical. 

## 😎 What's so cool about this

We're reimagining testing

1.) UI first approach. The web is about how it looks, and we help you ship pixel-perfect UIs.

2.) Low-code for primitive action. Just browser and done.

3.) Easiest and powerful way to integrate testing.

3.) Decreasing time to ship and increasing confidence.

4.) Making things simple and fast.

## 🛣️ Some use cases
- Testing your app e2e with commits or while in dev.
- Check responsiveness of your UIs.
- Ensuring app across different browsers.
- Get alerts when something fails.
- Debug system when bug..

## Is Crusher the right choice for me?
- Do you want to have complete testing suite?
- Does your site break in production and staging?
- Do you spend too much time in fixing countelss bugs.
- Do you care about quality of your web app?

If the answers to the above are YES, then Crusher would be a great fit. Crusher integrates seamlessly in < 5 mins.
